# Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates network traffic analysis using *Wireshark* in a controlled virtual lab.  
The lab setup included *Kali Linux (attacker)* and *Windows 11 (victim)* virtual machines.  

## Objectives
- Capture and analyze different types of network traffic.
- Understand how ICMP, HTTP, and DNS packets behave in real communication.
- Document findings using PCAPNG files and screenshots.

## Lab Setup
- Kali Linux VM → attacker machine
- Windows 11 VM → victim machine
- Wireshark installed on Windows 11 to capture packets.

## What I Did
1. Simulated traffic using ping (ICMP), web browsing (HTTP), and DNS queries.  
2. Captured packets using Wireshark and saved as .pcapng files.  
3. Analyzed traffic with filters and documented results with screenshots.  

## Files in this Repository
- */pcaps/* → Packet capture files (.pcapng).  
- */screenshots/* → Screenshots of protocol analysis.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic analysis  
- Protocol analysis (ICMP, HTTP, DNS)  
- Wireshark filtering and investigation  
- Virtual lab setup (Kali Linux + Windows 11)
